## CAUSAL LINKS
## Everything that derivates from the "causes" link type.
## Comprises both real causes and ownership ("carries").

### CARRIES

# To allow queries for patient carrying samples, and samples carrying alterations,
# without mixing with "effects" causes.

    is_a: causes
    represented_as: edge

### CAUSES

# A gene is linked to its functional outcome (gain or loss of function),
# which are represented as nodes, so as to allow a causal path
# to go through alteration -> gene outcome -> transcript activity.
# Hence, outcomes have at least two instances:
# - Gene:GoF, and
# - Gene:LoF.
# Same for proteins with:
# - Transcrit:Active, and
# - Transcript:Inactive.
# Incidentally: the source of an edge of type "causes"
# cannot be an inactive protein.

### BIOMARKER

# In some databases, such as OncoKB, drugs are associated with variants
# as predictive markers for treatment response, 
# based on clinical evidence categorized by evidence levels.
